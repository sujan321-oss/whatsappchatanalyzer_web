As a part of National Education Policy (NEP), and directions given by Principal secretary, Higher & Technical Education Department Mantralaya, Mumbai, it is necessary to implement Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) in our Institute. The ABC is beneficial to the students for credit accumulation, credit transfers and credit redemption. It allows the academic mobility of students with the freedom to study across the Higher Education Institutes.

As per the notified regulations of the establishment and operation of ABC in Higher Education, you are informed to complete ABC account creation of the students admitted during academic year 2021-22 (S. Y. B. Tech, S. Y. M. Tech, S. Y. MBA) and  academic year 2022-23 (F. Y. B. Tech, F. Y. M. Tech, F. Y. MBA).

The complete process to open an ABC account is explained in the document attached herewith. Kindly guide the students by displaying this process to create their account in an ABC with the help of class monitors. As per deadline, you are informe to complete this activity by 30th March 2023. Kindly keep the record of students' accounts created with their signature and submit it to us in hard copy form.

This is prerequisite before opening the ABC account, so those who have yet not linked their mobile number with Aadhar card, do it first and then open ABC account. After opening your ABC account you have to take printout of the same and submit it to yoor class monitor.
